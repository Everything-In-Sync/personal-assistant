    "Remember! The entire universe is only a pale shadow of your inner being. "
    "There is a sun out there because the real sun is in you. There is a "
    "moon in the sky because the real moon is within you. There are planets,"
    " stars and galaxies out there, but they are only a symbolic "
    "representation of the infinity inside you. There are gods and demons, "
    "UFOs and aliens, ghosts and monsters out there that can enslave you and eat "
    "you if you forget that they are mere figments of your own imagination. "
    "Realise that you yourself are the dreamer, the sole creator and governor "
    "of the entire universe and of all the matter that surrounds you which is no "
    "more than the dust of your own projections. The world exists because of you. "
    "Without you, the world simply collapses."
